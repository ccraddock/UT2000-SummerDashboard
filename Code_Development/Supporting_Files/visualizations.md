# Visualizations
Baisc visualizatiosn to consider for my component of the UT2000 Summer Dashboard

## Single Variable Figures

Sleep Stages
1. Bar Chart showing percentage of time spent in non-rem, rem, and awake sleep stages
  - Might want to show their efficiency rating as perhaps a grade?
  - Each sleep stage shown in a different color with awake at the top
  - Have both individual and indvidiual versus aggregate figures
2. Scatterplot showing the number of periodic wake episodes in the evening
  - Could overlay the background with different colors to know how many wake episodes are good, normal, or bad
  
PM2.5 Concentration
1. Time Series showing daily PM2.5 concentrations in their home
2. Time Series showing daily AQI for PM2.5 in their home
3. Bar Chart showing daily median concentrations in their home
  - Have both individual and indvidiual versus aggregate figures
  
Temperature and Relative Humidity
1. Time Series showing temperature profile over the day
2. Bar Chart comparing the average daily and average nightly temperatures
  - Have both individual and indvidiual versus aggregate figures
  
## Bivariate Figures

1. Bar Chart showing the percentage of time spent in/out of thermal comfort zone
  - Will first have to calculate the thermal comfort zone and see which points fall in this location
  - Have both individual and indvidiual versus aggregate figures
2. Scatterplot showing relationship between sleep efficiency and the perceived sleep quality
  - Will have to score the perceived sleep quality in some manner
3. Scatterplot showing the relationship between their sleep efficiency and the peak PM2.5 concentration while they are asleep
4. Scatterplot showing the relationship between their perceived sleep quality and the peak PM2.5 concentration while they are asleep
5. Scatterplot showing the relationship between their sleep efficiency and the median PM2.5 concentration while they are asleep
6. Scatterplot showing the relationship between their perceived sleep quality and the median PM2.5 concentration while they are asleep
