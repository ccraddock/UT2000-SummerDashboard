# UT2000 SummerDashboard
This project is dedicated to developing code that will be utilized into the Whole Communities, Whole Health Summer Dashboard effort. The project is aimed at importing, cleaning, deriving features, and visualizing data in a clear and coherent manner so that users may understand and use the results to improve some outcome in their immediate environment. 

## Frontend Development
The main component of the frontend that I need to develop is related to visualizations.

## Backend Development
In terms of backend development, there are two primary tasks:
1. Create some of the *lambda functions* that import and clean the data and store it in convenient/useful metrics.
2. Develop the structure of the modelts (database) that is used in the backend by Django.
